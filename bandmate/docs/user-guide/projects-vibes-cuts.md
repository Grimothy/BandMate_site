# Projects, Vibes & Cuts

BandMate organizes your music using a three-level hierarchy designed to match how bands naturally work.

## The Hierarchy

```
Project
  └── Vibe
        └── Cut
              └── Files (audio, stems, images)
```

### Projects

A **Project** is your top-level workspace. It represents a collection of related music -- an album, an EP, a set of demos, or anything you want to group together.

Each project has:
- A name and optional description
- A cover image
- A list of members with permissions
- One or more Vibes

**Examples:** "Summer EP 2026", "Live Session Recordings", "Songwriting Workshop"

### Vibes

A **Vibe** lives inside a Project. Think of it as a song idea, theme, or creative direction. Vibes let you group related takes together without losing track of different creative threads.

Each vibe has:
- A name and optional image
- One or more Cuts
- Drag-and-drop reordering within the project

**Examples:** "Sunset Groove", "Late Night Jam", "Acoustic Version"

### Cuts

A **Cut** is an individual take, mix, or version within a Vibe. This is where your actual audio files live.

Each cut has:
- A name
- Attached audio files
- Stem packages (ZIP uploads)
- A waveform player
- Timestamped comments

**Examples:** "Rough Demo", "Guitar Overdub Take 2", "Final Master"

Invited users receive an email (if email is configured) with a link to join.

### Organizing Vibes

- **Reorder Vibes:** Drag and drop vibes to change their order
- **Move Cuts Between Vibes:** Drag a cut from one vibe and drop it into another

### Managing Cuts

- **Upload Stems:** ZIP files are automatically detected and categorized as stems
- **Delete a Cut:** Use the context menu on the cut

## Tips

- Use Projects for high-level groupings (album, EP, session)
- Use Vibes for individual songs or creative directions
- Use Cuts for different versions or takes of the same idea
- The drag-and-drop system makes it easy to reorganize as your creative direction evolves
